    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        This project began in November 2023 and concluded in June 2024. I worked with a team of 3 other Chemical Engineering undergraduates to analyze the ammonia plant using thermodynamic, energy balance, and material balance methods. The scope of the project includes creating and annotating process flow diagrams, writing scripts in MATLAB to run repetitive calculations, using Excel to organize data, and extensive teamwork throughout.
